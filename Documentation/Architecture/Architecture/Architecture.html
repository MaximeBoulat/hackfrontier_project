    <h1>iPhone Image Analysis System Architecture</h1>

    <p>This system enables iPhone users to capture images through a React web application and receive automated analysis results. The React frontend runs on the iPhone, captures images using the device camera, and sends them to an Express.js backend server deployed on a separate endpoint. The Express server processes the image upload, forwards it to the Eyepop API for computer vision analysis, receives the structured analysis results, and returns a formatted response back to the React client for display to the user.</p>
